      "Usage": "```markdown\n## Usage\n\nDuneAI provides a flexible framework for orchestrating artificial intelligence workflows. The main components you will work with are Dynamics and Prompts, which allow the system to be both modular and adaptive. Below is a guide on how to effectively use DuneAI in your projects.\n\n### Core Concepts\n\n1. **Dynamics**: These are state-aware components that manage the execution of workflows. Dynamics can adapt based on the evolving state of the AI, allowing for dynamic orchestration of tasks.\n\n2. **Prompts**: Prompts interface with AI models using modular commands. They can leverage Mustache syntax for dynamic state injection, making it possible to shape workflows as they progress.\n\n### Basic Workflow\n\nHere is a simple example of how to use DuneAI to create a dynamic workflow:\n\n1. **Import DuneAI**: Make sure to import the necessary functions and models when creating your scripts.\n\n   ```typescript\n   import DuneAI from \"duneai\";\n   ```\n\n2. **Create a Prompt**: Define the prompts you will use in your dynamics. For example:\n\n   ```typescript\n   const prompt = {\n       name: \"GreetingPrompt\",\n       content: \"What would you like to say?\",\n       model: \"gpt-4o-mini\",\n   };\n   ```\n\n3. **Create a Dynamic**: Use the prompt within a dynamic framework. Here’s how you can set this up:\n\n   ```typescript\n   const greetingDynamic = DuneAI.createDynamic(\"GreetingDynamic\", {}, [prompt]);\n   ```\n\n4. **Run the Dynamic**: To execute the dynamic, you can call its `run` method:\n\n   ```typescript\n   (async () => {\n       const result = await greetingDynamic.run({});\n       console.log(result);\n   })();\n   ```\n\n### Advanced Configuration\n\nDuneAI also allows for advanced configurations, including using multiple prompts and incorporating logic for decision-making based on previous results. You can chain dynamics together or parameterize them based on user input or context.\n\n#### Example of Using Multiple Prompts\n\n```typescript\nconst multiPromptDynamic = DuneAI.createDynamic(\"MultiPromptDynamic\", {}, [\n    {\n        name: \"FirstPrompt\",\n        content: \"This is your first task.\",\n    },\n    {\n        name: \"SecondPrompt\",\n        content: \"Now proceed to the next task.\",\n    },\n]);\n\n(async () => {\n    const multiResult = await multiPromptDynamic.run({});\n    console.log(multiResult);\n})();\n```\n\n### Error Handling\n\nMake sure to implement error handling when using asynchronous calls. This ensures that unexpected behavior or failures can be managed gracefully.\n\n```typescript\n(async () => {\n    try {\n        const result = await greetingDynamic.run({});\n        console.log(result);\n    } catch (error) {\n        console.error(\"An error occurred while running the dynamic:\", error);\n    }\n})();\n```\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBy utilizing DuneAI's structure of Dynamics and Prompts, you can build responsive and intelligent AI workflows that adapt to dynamic conditions and user inputs. Explore the various features and APIs available in DuneAI to make the most of this orchestration framework.\n```\n",

Framework\n\nDuneAI is a breakthrough in artificial intelligence orchestration, built on the principles of cybernetics. As the world’s first open-source Cybernetic Orchestration Framework, DuneAI offers a new level of intelligence, flexibility, and adaptability to AI workflows. Unlike conventional systems, DuneAI enables AI to analyze its own outputs and adjust future actions, resulting in self-evolving, adaptive systems.\n\nWhat makes DuneAI unique is its ability to form cybernetic feedback loops—allowing AI to continuously refine its behavior based on its outputs. While traditional frameworks focus on chaining operations or retrieving data, DuneAI empowers AI to learn from its results and modify its decision-making process autonomously. This makes DuneAI particularly effective for complex workflows that require ongoing adaptation.\nThe Core of DuneAI\n\nDuneAI’s functionality is built around two core constructs: Dynamics and Prompts.\n\n    Dynamics are reusable, state-aware components that manage how workflows are executed. They adapt based on the AI's evolving state, allowing for flexible orchestration.\n\n    Prompts are modular commands that interface with AI models. Enhanced with Mustache syntax, Prompts allow dynamic state injection at runtime, ensuring interactions evolve as workflows progress. Prompts not only retrieve outputs but also shape the workflow in response to real-time state changes.\n\nThese constructs work together to enable adaptive orchestration, where workflows adjust and refine themselves through cybernetic feedback.\nA New Approach to AI Orchestration\n\nDuneAI offers a fresh approach to AI orchestration, focusing on self-refining workflows that evolve through continuous feedback. This adaptive capability goes beyond what is offered by traditional frameworks, providing more intelligent, autonomous systems for handling dynamic tasks.\n\nDuneAI is licensed under the MIT license and was created by Kenan Stipek with the support of the team at AllusionLabs.

Follow the steps below to get started:\n\n### Prerequisites\n\n1. **Node.js**: Ensure you have Node.js (version 14.x or later) installed on your machine. You can download Node.js from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).\n\n2. **npm (Node Package Manager)**: npm is included with Node.js. You can check if it's installed by running the following command in your terminal:\n\n   ```bash\n   npm -v\n   ```\n\n3. **Git**: Make sure Git is installed for version control and to clone repositories. Download it from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/).\n\n### Step-by-Step Installation\n\n1. **Clone the Repository**: Open a terminal window and run the following command to clone the DuneAI repository to your local machine:\n\n   ```bash\n   git clone https://github.com/KenanKStipek/DuneAI.git\n   ```\n\n2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**: Change your working directory to the newly cloned repository:\n\n   ```bash\n   cd DuneAI\n   ```\n\n3. **Install Dependencies**: Install the required dependencies by running:\n\n   ```bash\n   npm install\n   ```\n\n   This command will install all the necessary packages, including DuneAI's core libraries and optional adapters.\n\n4. **Setup Environment Variables**: DuneAI relies on various configuration options, including API keys for different providers. Create a `.env` file in the root of the project directory and define your variables, for example:\n\n   ```plaintext\n   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here\n   DEFAULT_MODEL=gpt-4o-mini\n   DEFAULT_ADAPTER=openai\n   ```\n\n5. **Run the Application**: After installing the dependencies and setting up your environment, you can start the application with the following command:\n\n   ```bash\n   npm start\n   ```\n\n### Additional Notes\n\n- If you are using TypeScript, you may want to install TypeScript globally by running:\n\n  ```bash\n  npm install -g typescript\n  ```\n\n- Check the [Documentation](https://github.com/KenanKStipek/DuneAI/wiki) for more detailed instructions on configuring additional features and settings.\n  \nWith these steps, you should be ready to begin your journey with DuneAI! If you encounter any issues, please refer to the [Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting) section of this README.\n``````markdown\n## Usage\n\nDuneAI provides a flexible framework for orchestrating artificial intelligence workflows. The main components you will work with are Dynamics and Prompts, which allow the system to be both modular and adaptive. Below is a guide on how to effectively use DuneAI in your projects.\n\n### Core Concepts\n\n1. **Dynamics**: These are state-aware components that manage the execution of workflows. Dynamics can adapt based on the evolving state of the AI, allowing for dynamic orchestration of tasks.\n\n2. **Prompts**: Prompts interface with AI models using modular commands. They can leverage Mustache syntax for dynamic state injection, making it possible to shape workflows as they progress.\n\n### Basic Workflow\n\nHere is a simple example of how to use DuneAI to create a dynamic workflow:\n\n1. **Import DuneAI**: Make sure to import the necessary functions and models when creating your scripts.\n\n   ```typescript\n   import DuneAI from \"duneai\";\n   ```\n\n2. **Create a Prompt**: Define the prompts you will use in your dynamics. For example:\n\n   ```typescript\n   const prompt = {\n       name: \"GreetingPrompt\",\n       content: \"What would you like to say?\",\n       model: \"gpt-4o-mini\",\n   };\n   ```\n\n3. **Create a Dynamic**: Use the prompt within a dynamic framework. Here’s how you can set this up:\n\n   ```typescript\n   const greetingDynamic = DuneAI.createDynamic(\"GreetingDynamic\", {}, [prompt]);\n   ```\n\n4. **Run the Dynamic**: To execute the dynamic, you can call its `run` method:\n\n   ```typescript\n   (async () => {\n       const result = await greetingDynamic.run({});\n       console.log(result);\n   })();\n   ```\n\n### Advanced Configuration\n\nDuneAI also allows for advanced configurations, including using multiple prompts and incorporating logic for decision-making based on previous results. You can chain dynamics together or parameterize them based on user input or context.\n\n#### Example of Using Multiple Prompts\n\n```typescript\nconst multiPromptDynamic = DuneAI.createDynamic(\"MultiPromptDynamic\", {}, [\n    {\n        name: \"FirstPrompt\",\n        content: \"This is your first task.\",\n    },\n    {\n        name: \"SecondPrompt\",\n        content: \"Now proceed to the next task.\",\n    },\n]);\n\n(async () => {\n    const multiResult = await multiPromptDynamic.run({});\n    console.log(multiResult);\n})();\n```\n\n### Error Handling\n\nMake sure to implement error handling when using asynchronous calls.
