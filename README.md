# DuneAI: AI Orchestration Framework

DuneAI is a highly opinionated AI framework designed for TypeScript, focusing on ease of use and advanced AI orchestration. It leverages runtime interpolation, multi-model support, and lifecycle hooks to make complex AI interactions simple and efficient.

## Usage

To get started with generating a story:

1. **Configure Environment Variables**

   Ensure you have your OpenAI API Key set up as an environment variable.

   ```sh
   export OPENAI_API_KEY='YOUR_API_KEY'
   ```

2. **Running the Script**

   ```sh
   npm run dev
   ```

3. **Example: Customizing Your Story**

   Modify parameters in `runPrimeDynamic` in `.skeleton/src/index.ts` to customize the genre, character count, paragraph count, and author.

   ```typescript
   import { runPrimeDynamic } from "./skeleton/src/dynamics";

   (async () => {
     const result = await runPrimeDynamic({
       genre: "science fiction",
       characterCount: 4,
       paragraphCount: 5,
       author: "Isaac Asimov",
     });
     console.log("Generated Story:", result);
   })();
   ```

### Adding Custom Prompts

Add your prompts as Mustache files in the `prompts` directory and use them in your dynamic structures. Hereâ€™s an example of how to create and use these prompts:

1. **Create Prompt Files**

   Create a file named `Introduction.prompt` in the `prompts` directory with the following content:

   ```mustache
   Write an introduction for a story set in a {{ genre }} world with {{ characterCount }} characters.
   ```

   Create another file named `Paragraph.prompt` in the `prompts` directory with the following content:

   ```mustache
   Continue the story with a paragraph that includes interactions between the characters.
   ```

2. **Import and Use Prompts**

   Modify the dynamic structure to use these prompts:

   ```typescript
   import { runPrimeDynamic } from "./skeleton/src/dynamics";
   import { importPrompts } from "./skeleton/src/utils";

   // Import prompts from files
   const { Introduction, Paragraph } = importPrompts([
     "prompts/Introduction.prompt",
     "prompts/Paragraph.prompt",
   ]);

   const storyDynamic = {
     name: "SciFiStory",
     kind: "chainOfThought",
     prompts: [
       { name: "Introduction", content: Introduction },
       { name: "Paragraph", content: Paragraph },
     ],
   };

   (async () => {
     const result = await runPrimeDynamic({
       genre: "science fiction",
       characterCount: 4,
       paragraphCount: 5,
       author: "Isaac Asimov",
     }, storyDynamic);
     console.log("Generated Story:", result);
   })();
   ```

## Core Components

### Prompts

Prompts are templates used to generate content. They can be created using Mustache files and imported using the `importPrompts` utility.

### Dynamics

Dynamics orchestrate the flow of prompts and manage the context and state. They can be of type "chainOfThought" or "treeOfThought".

### ImportPrompts and CreateDynamic

These utilities are used to import prompts and create dynamic structures.

```typescript
import { importPrompts, createDynamic } from 'duneai';

const { Introduction, Paragraph } = importPrompts([
  'prompts/Introduction.prompt',
  'prompts/Paragraph.prompt'
]);

const dynamic = createDynamic({
  name: 'Story',
  kind: 'chainOfThought',
  prompts: [{ Introduction }, { Paragraph }]
});
```

## Advanced Features

### Context and Generations stored in State

DuneAI stores both user-provided context and AI-generated responses, facilitating complex interactions and state management.

### Chain of Thought (COT) and Tree of Thought (TOT)

COT and TOT are techniques to manage and generate content in a sequential or branching manner.

### Iteration

DuneAI supports iterating over prompts and dynamics, allowing for repeated interactions and complex content generation.

### Spice (Runtime Prompt Pre-processing Snippets)

Spice allows for pre-processing of prompts at runtime, enabling dynamic content generation.

## Utilities

### Adapters

Adapters facilitate communication with various AI services and platforms.

- **GPT4ALL**: Local or custom text generation.
- **Vercel AI**: Seamless integration with Vercel AI services.
- **Standard Diffusion**: Image generation with Stable Diffusion.

### Factories

Factories allow for the composition and reuse of DuneAI instances.

### Observability with WORM

WORM (Workflow Orchestration and Regenerative Monitor) provides an observability dashboard for interstitial data processing within DuneAI instances.

## Upcoming Features

- Testing
- Data Regression Testing
- Fine Tuning
- Embeddings and vector search
- More entry points (REST API, Queue, etc.)
- ThinkingMachine: Auto-generated dynamic factories
- More Spice
- Additional adapters (e.g., HuggingFace)
